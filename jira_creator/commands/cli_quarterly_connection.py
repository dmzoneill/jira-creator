"""
This script defines a function cli_quarterly_connection that builds an employee report based on JIRA issues. It
searches for issues within the last 90 days, retrieves relevant information, and processes it using a PromptLibrary. In
case of a QuarterlyConnectionError, it handles the exception and re-raises it.

Functions:
- cli_quarterly_connection: Builds a quarterly employee report based on JIRA issues assigned to the current user.

Arguments:
- jira: A JIRA API client for interacting with JIRA issues.
- ai_provider: An AI provider for generating insights from the JIRA issues.

Exceptions:
- Raises exceptions if there are any issues with searching JIRA issues.

Side Effects:
- Prints "Building employee report".

Note: This function fetches JIRA issues created, resolved, updated, or commented on by the current user within the
last 90 days.
