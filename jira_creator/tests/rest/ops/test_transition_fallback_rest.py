"""
This script contains a unit test function test_migrate_fallback_transition to test the functionality of migrating an
issue using a client object. It mocks the HTTP requests made by the client and asserts the expected behavior based on
the responses. The test ensures that the issue is migrated successfully with the expected key and transitions being
called.

The test_migrate_fallback_transition function executes a test to verify the fallback transition in a migration process.
It
takes a client object as an argument, which is used to interact with the migration process. During the test, it modifies
the transitions_called list to track the transitions that have been called.

The mock_request function simulates a mock HTTP request with specified method, path, and optional parameters. It returns
different responses based on the conditions such as the path content and HTTP method used in the request. The function
handles scenarios like retrieving transitions, specific path endings, comments, and POST requests.

Exceptions:
None
